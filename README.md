# Non-Prehensile Manipulation Actions and Visual 6D Pose Estimation for Fruit Grasping Based on Tactile Sensing
This workspace extends the work of [Hogan et al.]() on the design of a Linear Model Predictive Control to perform _pushing_ manouvre under the quasi-static assumption in the Matlab environment through the [Gurobi optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/).
